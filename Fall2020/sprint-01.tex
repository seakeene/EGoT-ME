\begin{entry}{CMake Error running EGOT-DCM Dockerfile}{Dec 02, 2020}
    \objective 
    
    Determine the cause of the CMake error while running the dockerfile and modify file to get it to successfully build.
    
    \outline
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Try running to see if it was just Lorry or a machine issue.
        \item If it is a machine issue, modify configurations to ensure interoperability.
        \item If I get the error track down its cause and modify dockerfile to fix.
        \item Repeat until all builds are successful.
    \end{itemize}
